Circle The Cat
A strategy game written in C using the SDL library for graphics and fmod for sound.
The objective is to encircle the cat with green circles.
The cat uses the dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest way to safety, so it is really smart and hard to catch.
Tools : gcc, vim, valgrind
I want to thank every programmer that benefited me with any information or any program that i used.
I did my best and i challenge you to beat my cat :p
I would very grateful if you reported any bug,
